A simple CLI calculator.

## Testing

Test Calculator provides two ways of testing the application, unit tests and integration tests.

Run unit tests and integration tests with the command:
```sh
make test
```

### Unit Tests

Unit tests follow the conventional structure of having test files in the same package as implementation files. For example,
the file calculator.go in the `calculator` package has unit tests in the file `calculator_test.go`. The unit tests have
access to the package variables and functions. Unit tests should test the independent components of the application.

Run unit tests with the command:
```sh
make test_unit
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests have a dedicated `integration` package. This prevents exposing package level variables and functions that should
not be used during integration tests. Integration tests should test the entire application exercising multiple components verifying that
each component integrates with other components as expected.

Integration tests are initialized by the init_test.go `TestMain` function such that before each test it:
- Creates a temporary directory
- Builds the binary for `TestCalculator` in the temporary directory 
 
Each test has access to the `builtBinaryPath` variable in the `integration` package. Currently, there is only one test `TestCalculator` 
that follows the same table-driven structure as the unit tests. The test is provided an `input` slice of strings, `expected` string 
result, and `err` error result. The `input` is passed to the binary `builtBinaryPath`. Each `input` is successful if the output of 
`TestCalcuatlor` contains the string `expected` and equals the expected `err`, if `err` is defined.

Run integration tests with the command:
```sh
make test_integration
```

### Usage

The Makefile contains commands for building and testing Test Calculator.

To see the available commands run `make help`.

```

```

### Continuous Integration

Every pull request runs both unit and integration tests when it is open or a new commit is pushed. All tests must pass in order to merge
to the `main` branch. The output of the test results can be views in the Github Action and is formatted with `gotestfmt` to improve readability.
The json output of the test run is saved as the artifact `test-log` for each run to allow downloading and inspecting the results.

To see the test results for the pipelines, view the tests workflows in actions. Additionally, a [![test status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mikesmithgh/TestCalculator/test.yml?style=flat-square&logo=github&logoColor=c7c7c7&label=tests&labelColor=282828&event=push)](https://github.com/mikesmithgh/TestCalculator/actions/workflows/test.yml?query=event%3Apush)
status badge is provided at the top of this README to indicate if tests have passed for the latest commit on the `main` branch.
